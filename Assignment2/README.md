# Drawing on the Web
### Assignment 2 - SVG

Second Assignment for CSCI-UA.0380-002 - Drawing on the Web

  - Created two SVG collages
  - Placed into my existing portfolio template
  - Uploaded to github (sufficient for assignment 4)

Below are the instructions for the assignment 

> Create your SVG with a text editor, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or any combination of these. Your collage should include at least three SVG layers with unique IDs and each layer should include a unique vector graphic. One or more of your SVG forms should be an active link.
Target these forms with CSS and apply styles to the SVG of your collage. Add hover and active pseudo-classes to each SVG graphic link so that it changes in some way when a user mouses over and clicks on it. All of these components should appear on a single HTML Web page; give your collage a title and add it to the head section of the page.
The subject matter for this project is up to you and should be thoughtfully considered.
