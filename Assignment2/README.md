[Link to Asignment](http://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~jcc608/drawingOnTheWeb/assignment2/)

### Criteria
- At least three SVG layers/groups with unique IDs (2 points)
- At least three vector graphics in the SVG element (3 points)
- An active link applied to at least one of the SVG graphics (1 point)
- CSS styles applied to SVG layers (2 points)
- Dynamic pseudo-classes (hover and active) that change SVG graphic links (1 point)
- Good HTML, CSS, and SVG markup (1 point)

Below are the instructions for the assignment 

> Create your SVG with a text editor, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or any combination of these. Your collage should include at least three SVG layers with unique IDs and each layer should include a unique vector graphic. One or more of your SVG forms should be an active link.
Target these forms with CSS and apply styles to the SVG of your collage. Add hover and active pseudo-classes to each SVG graphic link so that it changes in some way when a user mouses over and clicks on it. All of these components should appear on a single HTML Web page; give your collage a title and add it to the head section of the page.
The subject matter for this project is up to you and should be thoughtfully considered.
