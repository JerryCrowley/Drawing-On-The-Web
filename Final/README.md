Using three.js, create a WebGL scene that animates 3D geometry in some kind of three-dimensional context. The context could be a surface plane, a constellation, a skybox, etc. The object you create should be intriguing—something you might pick up or touch if you came across it. Your project should include at least two 3D models (the object and its context), basic animation, a custom texture for the object’s material, lighting, and shadow. In addition, use OrbitControls.js to give viewers the ability to move around the scene.
